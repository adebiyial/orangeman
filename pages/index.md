{% timeline-block .inception %}
## Inception {% .title %}
Sometimes in August, 2013, I wrote my first line of code (on paper) in Java. In my time in the [University of Ilorin](https://bit.ly/3ztwU3I), as a computer science undergrad (2013 - 2017), I wrote some code in the C language, much more in C++, and a lot in C#.

{% timeline-block .past-life %}
## In a past life {% .title %}
C# was fun. We weren't taught in school but I'd discovered it (and Visual Studio), and loved it.
---
I created some Windows applications with C#, eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML), Windows Presentation Form (WPF), and Windows Forms. And then I didn't. As a student my PC wasn't powerful enough to effectively run Visual Studio and I couldn't afford a high-speed internet too. Fortunately, I discovered the web.

{% timeline-block .the-web %}
## Caught in the web {% .title %}
I remember writing HTML and CSS, just like yesterday, and immediately seeing the result in the browser. Coming from the C# and Visual Studio expericnee, that was a big and enticing improvement. I was Caught in the Web, for good.
---
On the web, the simplicities of [inventing on principle](https://bit.ly/3fgkFR4) is alluring, the complexities, humbling, and the closure, satisfying.

{% timeline-block .ongoings %}
## How it's going {% .title %}
Today, I am a User Interface and Frontend Engineer. I really love to craft user interfaces on the web. I first fell in love with the web in those early days because I could watch my code come alive in the browser in a matter of seconds, and because unlike other medium, the blank canvas of the browsers viewport is your oyster.

{% timeline-block .edgio %}
## Working at Edgio {% .title %}
I work at [Edgio](https://edg.io) as a Developer Advocate in the community support team, where I help [potential] customers understand the internet's need for performance and security [at scale], through articles or code.
---
In early 2022, I rebuilt the [Edgio documentation](https://docs.edg.io) from scratch by studying [React's beta documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org).
---
I also manage the documentation by writing content in collaboration with the Engineering team and I have contributed to an [e-book](https://bit.ly/3Nn31Yr) about [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals) with folks from companies like Algolia, and Cloudinary etc.

{% timeline-block .writing-reading %}
## Writing and Reading {% .title %}
Writing — and reading — has always been much of what I do and who I am. It's the hand I got dealt during my formative years when I had no imagination of what I'd do, where I'd go, or who I'd become. I just wanted to read and write, a lot.

{% timeline-block .lab %}
## Laboratory {% .title %}
In the early days of my web development journey, I used to pick apart websites and rebuild them. It could be navs, buttons, footers, cards, anything. I still experiment in that way today with UI components. I love how the disintegrated part can be composed to form something meaningful and functional.

{% timeline-block .csc %}
## Beneath the surface {% .title %}
At the heart of it, I am a Computer Scientist who strives to understand anything computing-related. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. One of my biggest achievement was my final year project: Digital Data Mining from [Forensic Linguistics](https://n.pr/3sELB02). At the time I worked on this project, I was unaware the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had used Forensic Linguistics in the Manhunt, Unabomber serial killer case of 1996.

{% timeline-block .septum %}
## The Septum: the center that holds {% .title %}
I founded a media and publication company, [The Septum](https://theseptum.com), focused on creating content that fosters the art of communication in many forms such as writing, podcasts, videos, and more.
